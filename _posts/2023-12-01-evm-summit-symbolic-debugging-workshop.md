I recently had the honor of leading a 1-hour workshop at the inaugural EVMSummit in Istanbul, focusing on the EVM low-level debugging capabilities of the Symbolic Solidity debugger. It was a deep dive into the intricacies of EVM and how our tool can effectively tackle complex debugging challenges.

A heartfelt thank you to all the participants for their enthusiasm and engagement. The discussions we had were not only insightful but also sparked a myriad of ideas and perspectives. It's interactions like these that drive innovation and collective growth in our field.

Grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this landmark event and looking forward to many more!
