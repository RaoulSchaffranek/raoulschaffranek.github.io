Thrilled to share insights from my recent presentation at DevCon Bogota! Titled "Tackling Rounding Errors with Precision Analysis", the talk highlighted a crucial aspect of smart contract security: the impact of rounding in the wrong direction.

We also reveald [kontrol](https://kontrol.runtimeverification.com/) for the first time, a tool born from the integration of KEVM and Foundry, designed to address these challenges. It's a step forward in enhancing the precision and safety of smart contracts. Honored to contribute to this evolving field!
