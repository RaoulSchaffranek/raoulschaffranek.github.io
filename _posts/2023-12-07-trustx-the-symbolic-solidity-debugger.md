On November 14th, 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to present at the TrustX conference in Istanbul! My topic, "The Symbolic Solidity Debugger," focuses on making symbolic execution more accessible to everyone. I'm so grateful for the chance to share this innovative tool and connect with so many passionate individuals. What an unforgettable experience!
